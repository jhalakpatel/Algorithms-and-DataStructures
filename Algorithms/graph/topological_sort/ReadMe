Topological sort uses:
1. Dependency resolution
2. Scheduling jobs from the given dependencies among jobs. 

Applications of this type arise in :
1. Instruction scheduling
2. Ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing formula values in spreadsheets, logic synthesis.

Time Complexity : O(V+E), similar to DFS (af its a DFS with extra stack). V = vertices, E = edges

Space Complexity :
